From time to time people suggest to me that scientists ought to give more consideration to social problems especially that they should be more responsible in considering the impact of science on society. It seems to be generally believed that if the scientists would only look at these very difficult social problems and not spend so much time fooling with less vital scientific ones great success would come of it.

It seems to me that we do think about these problems from time to time but we don’t put a full-time effort into them the reasons being that we know we don’t have any magic formula for solving social problems that social problems are very much harder than scientific ones and that we usually don’t get anywhere when we do think about them.

I believe that a scientist looking at nonscientific problems is just as dumb as the next guy and when he talks about a nonscientific matter he sounds as naive as anyone untrained in the matter. Since the question of the value of science is not a scientific subject this talk is dedicated to proving my point by example.

The first way in which science is of value is familiar to everyone. It is that scientific knowledge enables us to do all kinds of things and to make all kinds of things. Of course if we make good things it is not only to the credit of science it is also to the credit of the moral choice which led us to good work. Scientific knowledge is an enabling power to do either good or bad but it does not carry instructions on how to use it. Such power has evident value even though the power may be negated by what one does with it.

I learned a way of expressing this common human problem on a trip to Honolulu. In a Buddhist temple there the man in charge explained a little bit about the Buddhist religion for tourists and then ended his talk by telling them he had something to say to them that they would never forget and I have never forgotten it. It was a proverb of the Buddhist religion:

To every man is given the key to the gates of heaven the same key opens the gates of hell.

What then is the value of the key to heaven? It is true that if we lack clear instructions that enable us to determine which is the gate to heaven and which the gate to hell the key may be a dangerous object to use.

But the key obviously has value: how can we enter heaven without it? Instructions would be of no value without the key. So it is evident that in spite of the fact that it could produce enormous horror in the world science is of value because it can produce something.

Another value of science is the fun called intellectual enjoyment which some people get from reading and learning and thinking about it and which others get from working in it. This is an important point one which is not considered enough by those who tell us it is our social responsibility to reflect on the impact of science on society.

Is this mere personal enjoyment of value to society as a whole? No! But it is also a responsibility to consider the aim of society itself. Is it to arrange matters so that people can enjoy things? If so then the enjoyment of science is as important as anything else.

But I would like not to underestimate the value of the world view which is the result of scientific effort. We have been led to imagine all sorts of things infinitely more marvelous than the imaginings of poets and dreamers of the past. It shows that the imagination of nature is far far greater than the imagination of man. For instance how much more remarkable it is for us all to be stuck half of us upside down by a mysterious attraction to a spinning ball that has been swinging in space for billions of years than to be carried on the back of an elephant supported on a tortoise swimming in a bottomless sea.

I have thought about these things so many times alone that I hope you will excuse me if I remind you of this type of thought that I am sure many of you have had which no one could ever have had in the past because people then didn’t have the information we have about the world today.

For instance I stand at the seashore alone and start to think.

There are the rushing waves
mountains of molecules
each stupidly minding its own business
trillions apart
yet forming white surf in unison.
Ages on ages before any eyes could see
year after year
thunderously pounding the shore as now.
For whom for what?
On a dead planet
with no life to entertain.
Never at rest
tortured by energy
wasted prodigiously by the sun
poured into space.
A mite makes the sea roar.
Deep in the sea
all molecules repeat
the patterns of one another
till complex new ones are formed.
They make others like themselves
and a new dance starts.
Growing in size and complexity
living things
masses of atoms
DNA protein
dancing a pattern ever more intricate.
Out of the cradle
onto dry land
here it is
standing:
atoms with consciousness;
matter with curiosity.
Stands at the sea
wonders at wondering: I
a universe of atoms
an atom in the universe.

The same thrill the same awe and mystery comes again and again when we look at any question deeply enough. With more knowledge comes a deeper more wonderful mystery luring one on to penetrate deeper still. Never concerned that the answer may prove disappointing with pleasure and confidence we turn over each new stone to find unimagined strangeness leading on to more wonderful questions and mysteries certainly a grand adventure!

It is true that few unscientific people have this particular type of religious experience. Our poets do not write about it; our artists do not try to portray this remarkable thing. I don’t know why. Is no one inspired by our present picture of the universe? This value of science remains unsung by singers: you are reduced to hearing not a song or poem but an evening lecture about it. This is not yet a scientific age.

Perhaps one of the reasons for this silence is that you have to know how to read the music. For instance the scientific article may say “The radioactive phosphorus content of the cerebrum of the rat decreases to one-half in a period of two weeks.” Now what does that mean?

It means that phosphorus that is in the brain of a rat and also in mine and yours is not the same phosphorus as it was two weeks ago. It means the atoms that are in the brain are being replaced: the ones that were there before have gone away.

So what is this mind of ours: what are these atoms with consciousness? Last week’s potatoes! They now can remember what was going on in my mind a year ago a mind which has long ago been replaced.

To note that the thing I call my individuality is only a pattern or dance that is what it means when one discovers how long it takes for the atoms of the brain to be replaced by other atoms. The atoms come into my brain dance a dance and then go out there are always new atoms but always doing the same dance remembering what the dance was yesterday.

When we read about this in the newspaper it says “Scientists say this discovery may have importance in the search for a cure for cancer.” The paper is only interested in the use of the idea not the idea itself. Hardly anyone can understand the importance of an idea it is so remarkable. Except that possibly some children catch on. And when a child catches on to an idea like that we have a scientist. It is too late for them to get the spirit when they are in our universities so we must attempt to explain these ideas to children.

I would now like to turn to a third value that science has. It is a little less direct but not much. The scientist has a lot of experience with ignorance and doubt and uncertainty and this experience is of very great importance I think. When a scientist doesn’t know the answer to a problem he is ignorant. When he has a hunch as to what the result is he is uncertain. And when he is pretty darn sure of what the result is going to be he is still in some doubt. We have found it of paramount importance that in order to progress we must recognize our ignorance and leave room for doubt. Scientific knowledge is a body of statements of varying degrees of certainty some most unsure some nearly sure but none absolutely certain.

Now we scientists are used to this and we take it for granted that it is perfectly consistent to be unsure that it is possible to live and not know. But I don’t know whether everyone realizes this is true. Our freedom to doubt was born out of a struggle against authority in the early days of science. It was a very deep and strong struggle: permit us to question to doubt to not be sure. I think that it is important that we do not forget this struggle and thus perhaps lose what we have gained. Herein lies a responsibility to society.

We are all sad when we think of the wondrous potentialities human beings seem to have as contrasted with their small accomplishments. Again and again people have thought that we could do much better. Those of the past saw in the nightmare of their times a dream for the future. We of their future see that their dreams in certain ways surpassed have in many ways remained dreams. The hopes for the future today are in good share those of yesterday.

It was once thought that the possibilities people had were not developed because most of the people were ignorant. With universal education could all men be Voltaires? Bad can be taught at least as efficiently as good. Education is a strong force but for either good or evil.

Communications between nations must promote understanding so went another dream. But the machines of communication can be manipulated. What is communicated can be truth or lie. Communication is a strong force but also for either good or evil.

The applied sciences should free men of material problems at least. Medicine controls diseases. And the record here seems all to the good. Yet there are some patiently working today
